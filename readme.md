# Samba Home Permission Fixer

Samba fix perms is python script for mass changing home's directories permissions.
If yours home are stored as /home/%u (where %u is user login) you can use this script to correct file permissions on disk. It's handy when:

  - you moved/migrate homes from source without correct perms.
  - your ldb or idmap got corrupted
  - created new domain with old files
